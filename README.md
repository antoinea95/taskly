## Overview
This project is a tool for creating Kanban boards and managing projects. It allows users to organize tasks visually using boards, lists, and cards, making it easier to track progress and collaborate effectively. I developed this clone using **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN**, **React**, and **Firebase** to enhance the quality of my code and improve my TypeScript skills. I utilized **React Query** to manage requests to Firebase and created a class to avoid code repetition for subscribing to the database, among other functionalities. Additionally, I employed **Zod** and **React Hook Form** to manage forms and validate data, and **React Router** for seamless navigation within the application.



## Features
- **Authentication**: Users can log in and manage their boards securely.
- **User Management**: Board creators can add other users to collaborate on projects.
- **Board Creation**: Users can create boards for different projects.
- **List Management**: Each board can contain multiple lists to organize tasks.
- **Card Addition**: Users can add cards to each list to represent individual tasks.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Rearrange cards within lists and move them between lists.
- **Task Assignment**: Users can assign tasks to team members.
- **Deadlines**: Users can set deadlines for tasks to ensure timely completion.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on tasks for better collaboration and communication.
